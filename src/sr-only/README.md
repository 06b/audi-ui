## Introduction

The Audi UI (AUI) **sr-only** component hides an element to all devices except screen readers.

### To include an AUI **sr-only** component:

&nbsp;1. Code whatever element you want to hide.
```html
<span>Hide to all devices except screen readers<span>
```

&nbsp;2. Add AUI class, to the element using the `class` attribute.
```html
<span class="aui-sr-only">Hidden to all devices except screen readers<span>
```

The sr-only component is ready for use.
